## BIGLAW AI

Welcome to the development documentation for the BIGLAW-AI project. In this documentation, we will discuss the essential tools used in our application and provide insights into how everything works together.

## What is BIGLAW-AI
BIGLAW AI is an AI powered application dedicated to revolutionizing the way corporate lawyers work by providing cutting-edge solutions tailored to their specific needs. Our primary focus is on enhancing efficiency and streamlining the process of preparing contracts and agreements while maintaining the highest standards of data security and privacy.

## Features
- Drafting and Summarizing Agreements: BiglawAI excels in converting term sheets into comprehensive, legally enforceable agreements, customized to meet the unique requirements of each agreement. It can also simplify complex agreements into concise term sheets, making them more understandable and communicable. This service is available in multiple languages, including Chinese, Spanish, and French, making it invaluable for lawyers working with diverse clients worldwide.
  
- Data Security and Privacy: Recognizing the sensitivity of legal documents, BiglawAI prioritizes the security and privacy of customer data. Their scrubbing system removes sensitive information before transmitting data or documents to an online API, ensuring the confidentiality and security of clients' information throughout the process.

- Streamlined Online Text Editing: BiglawAI provides an integrated online text editor that simplifies the process of refining and polishing generated drafts. This feature enables corporate lawyers to efficiently review and edit documents, ensuring they meet precise specifications and adhere to the highest legal standards.

- Full Agreement Generation: They aim to generate complete agreement drafts directly from term sheets, eliminating the need for users to interactively create separate sections.


## Tools
### Next.js ![image](https://github.com/Abdulhamid97Mousa/biglawai_frontend_mongodb/assets/80536675/c7788dcb-1587-49e9-8fa3-3e612201edea)

Description: Next.js is a popular framework for building React applications. It offers the following key features:

Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved performance and SEO.
First-class support for various tools and libraries.
CSS modules for styling, ensuring better encapsulation of styles.
TypeScript integration for type safety.
Image optimization for efficient asset management.
Usage in BIGLAW-AI: We use Next.js as the foundation for our frontend, taking advantage of its performance-enhancing features and flexibility.

### Prisma ![image](https://github.com/Abdulhamid97Mousa/biglawai_frontend_mongodb/assets/80536675/d49e9ccc-f3b2-43b4-9afa-cdc1d1be8e96)

Description: Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that provides Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities for interacting with databases in an object-oriented manner. Key aspects of Prisma include:

Prisma Client: An auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js and TypeScript.
Usage in BIGLAW-AI: Prisma is instrumental in managing our database operations, offering a type-safe and efficient way to interact with our data.

### MongoDB ![image](https://github.com/Abdulhamid97Mousa/biglawai_frontend_mongodb/assets/80536675/01c55ec9-95c8-44e0-8d51-1d7461a19e2d)

Description: MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database designed for high-volume data storage. Instead of traditional tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections and documents to store data.

Usage in BIGLAW-AI: We utilize MongoDB as our primary data store, benefiting from its scalability and flexibility for managing large volumes of data.

### TypeScript ![image](https://github.com/Abdulhamid97Mousa/biglawai_frontend_mongodb/assets/80536675/b255bb0a-17fd-4346-9b19-d004a2d7abb4)

Description: TypeScript is an open-source language that builds upon JavaScript by introducing static type definitions. Key advantages of TypeScript include:

Enhanced developer tooling, such as autocompletion and type checking.
Improved code robustness.
Usage in BIGLAW-AI: TypeScript plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and maintainability of our codebase by adding static type checking.
